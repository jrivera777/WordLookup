# Word Lookup Widget

## Purpose:

Often while writing I forget how to spell a word, either because it's one of
those tricky words that never stick in my mind or because it's a "fancy" word,
not often used. I also sometimes have the problem where I use a word, but then
become paranoid that I am using it incorrectly, so I want to know the definition.

Because of my apparently inability to use the English language effectively,
I find myself constantly going to google.com to look up the word using Google's
dictionary definition feature `define *word*` It displays the word definition,
spelling, pronunciation, and more. Good stuff. 

As nice as that is, it's a pain if I don't have a browser open for
whatever reason. So this leads to this little project. A desktop widget-type
thing I can simply type into and have give similar results to the Google search.

All this may seem stupid or boring, but there is a second, equally
important goal: learn and become more comfortable using python. I have limited
experience with it, and I know it's all the rage now, so I might as well catch
up.
